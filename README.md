## Description
This responsive website is presenting my portfolio as a web developer. It was my first project on CareerFoundry Web developer Course and will be continuously updated. It's created in HTML & CSS from scratch with no framework used. It is fully responsive & contains CSS flexbox, grid, transitions, animations.

The goal for this project was to create a simple website portfolio without the use of libraries. I'm always looking for new ways or use of technologies to showcase my personal work to implement in my portfolio website. Maybe using Create React App in my next version and use _Figma_ and a style guide. I never run out of new ideas! 

## Planned updates:
- [ ] New style-sheet
- [ ] Hero image, whole width
- [ ] Logo, fine design
- [ ] Animation, vector
- [ ] New footer with scroll up button
- [ ] Contact form with validation?
- [ ] monthly content for let's start 'blogging'
- [ ] Develop new version with Create React App?
- [ ] Learn about Formik
- [x] External hosting branche 
- [ ] subpages routing
- [x] Medium icon
- [ ] Add Casestudy, Meet
- [ ] Add Project, Python
- [x] Button, handling e-mail
